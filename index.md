## About Me

I'm a computer science student at the University of Michigan with a strong focus on **Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering**. My interests in development include intelligent systems and autonomous software, analyzing data to drive insights, and building full-stack applications.  

This portfolio highlights select projects where I applied analytical, development, and engineering skills to solve meaningful problems, or projects that I just enjoyed. Each project includes a detailed explanation of my objectives, approach, and key takeaways. Direct links to project repositories are available on each individual project page.
