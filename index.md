## About Me

I'm a computer science student at the University of Michigan with a strong focus on **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering**. My interests span across developing intelligent systems, analyzing data to drive insights, and building full-stack applications.  

This portfolio highlights select projects where I applied analytical, development, and engineering skills to solve meaningful problems, or ones that I just enjoyed. Each project includes a detailed explanation of my objectives, approach, and key takeaways. Direct links to project repositories are available on each individual project page.

## My Projects

### Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning

- [**Power Outage Analysis**](./projects/power-outage.html)  
  *Predicting the financial impact of major U.S. power outages (2000–2016) using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and Random Forest regression.*  
  **Skills:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Regression Modeling, Hyperparameter Tuning

- [**AlphaZero Othello AI**](./projects/alz.html)  
  *Implemented an AlphaZero-based agent for Othello using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) combined with a deep convolutional neural network. Designed all MCTS phases—selection, expansion, simulation, backpropagation—and integrated neural network predictions to improve gameplay through self-play.*  
  **Skills:** Python, PyTorch, Reinforcement Learning, MCTS, Neural Networks, Self-Play, AlphaZero, Game AI
  
- [**CIFAR-10 Image Classifier**](./projects/img.html)  
  *Developed and trained both Fully-Connected and Convolutional Neural Networks for CIFAR-10 image classification. Conducted hyperparameter tuning through grid search and visualized model predictions, ensuring deterministic behavior across runs.*  
  **Skills:** Python, PyTorch, CNNs, Neural Networks, Hyperparameter Tuning, Image Classification, Reproducibility

- [**Connect Four AI**](./projects/connect_four.html)  
  *A Connect Four agent using Minimax search with Alpha-Beta pruning, complete with an interactive Pygame UI. The AI evaluates game states efficiently to beat human players in optimal moves.*  
  **Skills:** Python, AI Search Algorithms, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Game Development, Pygame

---

### Mobile Application and Web Development
- [**Wait Fast**](./projects/wait_fast.html)  
  *Full-stack mobile app designed to optimize queue management in real-time, integrating a user-friendly front-end and responsive backend.*  
  **Skills:** Python, SQL, Mobile UI/UX, Backend API Development, Full-Stack Engineering

---

### Competitive & Systems-Level Programming
- [**Custom C++ Thread Library**](./projects/thread2.html)  
  *Designed a cooperative thread library in C++, implementing context switching, mutexes, and condition variables using low-level `ucontext` primitives. Ensured FIFO scheduling, efficient CPU management, and robust interrupt handling.*  
  **Skills:** C++, Systems Programming, Thread Scheduling, Context Switching, Mutexes & Monitors, RAII, Exception Handling

- [**LC-2K Assembler and Pipeline Simulator**](./projects/assembler.html)  
  *C implementation of an LC-2K assembler and a 5-stage pipelined processor simulator. The assembler translates assembly code to machine code, handling label resolution, symbol management, and error checking. The simulator models fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages with data hazard detection, stalling, and forwarding logic.*  
  **Skills:** C, Systems Programming, Assembly Language, Pipeline Simulation, Hazard Detection, Debugging, Memory Management

- [**LC-2K Cache Simulator**](./projects/cache_simulator.html)  
  *Implemented a configurable cache simulator in C, modeling set-associative caches with adjustable block sizes, set counts, and associativity levels. Integrated a Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy, write-back behavior, and detailed logging of cache hits, misses, memory accesses, and evictions.*  
  **Skills:** C, Systems Programming, Cache Simulation, Memory Management, Bit Manipulation, Debugging, Performance Analysis

- [**Traveling Salesman Problem Solver**](./projects/project-tsp.html)  
  *C++ implementation of MST, Fast Insertion Heuristic, and Optimal Branch & Bound solutions for TSP. Includes command-line interface and automated test scripts.*  
  **Skills:** C++, Algorithm Design, MST, Branch & Bound, Heuristics, Bash Scripting
