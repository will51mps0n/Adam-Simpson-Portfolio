## About Me

I'm a computer science student at the University of Michigan with a strong focus on **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering**. My interests span across developing intelligent systems, analyzing data to drive insights, and building full-stack applications.  

This portfolio highlights select projects where I applied analytical, development, and engineering skills to solve meaningful problems, or ones that I just enjoyed. Each project includes a detailed explanation of my objectives, approach, and key takeaways. Direct links to project repositories are available on each individual project page.

## My Projects


### Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning

- [**Power Outage Analysis - Python & ML**](./projects/power-outage.html)  
  *Predicting the financial impact of major U.S. power outages (2000–2016) using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and Random Forest regression for prediction. The analysis outlines my process and findings on the dataset.*  
  **Skills:** Pandas, Numpy, Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Regression Modeling, Hyperparameter Tuning

- [**Stock Price Analysis and Prediction - Python**](./projects/stock.html)  
  *Developed a comprehensive pipeline for stock price analysis, incorporating data retrieval from the Financial Modeling Prep API, computation of technical indicators, and implementation of machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM networks for predictive analytics.*  
  **Skills:** Data Retrieval, Technical Analysis, Machine Learning, Time Series Forecasting, API Integration

- [**AlphaZero Othello - Python & AI**](./projects/alz.html)  
  *Implemented an AlphaZero-based agent for Othello using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) combined with a deep convolutional neural network. Designed all MCTS phases—selection, expansion, simulation, backpropagation—and integrated neural network predictions to improve gameplay through self-play.*  
  **Skills:** Python, PyTorch, Reinforcement Learning, MCTS, Neural Networks, Unsupervised Learning
  
- [**CIFAR-10 Image Classifier - Python & AI**](./projects/img.html)  
  *Developed and trained both Fully-Connected and Convolutional Neural Networks for CIFAR-10 image classification. Conducted hyperparameter tuning through grid search and visualized model predictions, ensuring deterministic behavior across runs.*  
  **Skills:** PyTorch, CNNs, Neural Networks, Hyperparameter Tuning

- [**Connect Four - Python & AI**](./projects/connect_four.html)  
  *A Connect Four agent using Minimax search with Alpha-Beta pruning, complete with an interactive Pygame UI. The AI evaluates game states efficiently to beat human players in optimal moves.*  
  **Skills:** AI Search Algorithms, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Pygame

---

### Mobile Application and Web Development
- [**Wait Fast - Python, Swift, & SQL**](./projects/wait_fast.html)  
  *Full-stack mobile app designed to optimize queue management in real-time, integrating a user-friendly front-end and responsive backend.*  
  **Skills:** Full-Stack Engineering - Mobile UI/UX, Backend API Development, Database Management

---

### Competitive & Systems-Level Programming
- [**Custom Thread Library - C++**](./projects/thread2.html)  
  *Designed a cooperative thread library in C++, implementing context switching, mutexes, and condition variables using low-level `ucontext` primitives. Ensured FIFO scheduling, efficient CPU management, and robust interrupt handling.*  
  **Skills:** Operating Systems Programming, Thread Scheduling, Context Switching, Mutexes & Monitors, RAII

- [**LC-2K Assembler and Pipeline Simulator - C and Assembly**](./projects/assembler.html)  
  *C implementation of an LC-2K assembler and a 5-stage pipelined processor simulator. The assembler translates assembly code to machine code, handling label resolution, symbol management, and error checking.*  
  **Skills:** Systems Programming, Assembly Language, Pipeline Simulation

- [**LC-2K Cache Simulator**](./projects/cache.html)  
  *Implemented a configurable cache simulator in C, modeling set-associative caches with adjustable block sizes, set counts, and associativity levels. Integrated a Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy, write-back behavior, and detailed logging of cache hits, misses, memory accesses, and evictions.*  
  **Skills:** Systems Programming, Cache Simulation, Memory Management, Bit Manipulation

- [**Traveling Salesman Problem Solver - C++**](./projects/tsp.html)  
  *C++ implementation of MST, Fast Insertion Heuristic, and Optimal Branch & Bound solutions for TSP. Includes command-line interface and automated test scripts.*  
  **Skills:** Algorithm Design, MST, Branch & Bound, Heuristics, Bash Scripting
